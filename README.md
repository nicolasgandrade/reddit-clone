> [Under Development] Spreddit is a Reddit clone made in Spring Boot and Angular. This repository is the backend of the app, made with Spring Boot, Spring Data (JPA), Spring Security (JWT Authentication) and PostgreSQL.


### Adjustments and Improvements

The backend (this repo) is almost complete. However, I'm still building the frontend with Angular 13. These are the main features built so far:
- [x] Register user and login/logout
- [x] Verify account by email-sent verification token
- [x] Use JWT tokens to make requests
- [x] Create Subreddits
- [x] Make posts inside the subreddits
- [x] Comment on posts

## ðŸ’» Requirements

Before starting, make sure you meet the following requirements:
* Install `Java 11`
* Read the documentation in `${depoy url (still not deployed)}/swagger-ui/`
* Transform application.properties.example to `application.properties`.
* Create an account in `MailTrap` and replace the fields in `application.properties` to you informations.
* Create a database called `redditclone` in your PostgreSQL.
* Replace the port of you database. If you didn't change it before, it must be `5432`.
* Change the method `getApiInfo` from SwaggerConfig class to your information.

Now you can start the API.
